# Overview

I wanted to create this application in python to relearn some basic programming logic and some object oriented design principles.

This is a car purchasing application, where a user is given a list of cars to purhcase. Based on the year of the make and model of the car, the program then shows the user
list of prices for that chosen car.

This simple car purchasing program helped me recollect most of the python syntax I have forgotten or do not know.

Here is a video demo link to the program, where I explain how it works.

# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.10

# Useful Websites

{Make a list of websites that you found helpful in this project}
* Real Python](https://realpython.org)

# Future Work
* Add a file system where each purchase is stored in a file as inventory and displayed to the user on command
* Present a larger list of vehicles, make and model to user to give them more options
* Utilise OOP to encapsulate functions in the program.
